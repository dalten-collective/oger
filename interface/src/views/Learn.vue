                  Peat is a response to a community demand for backing up and
                  restoring social graphs on Urbit. Peat comes as the culmination
                  of a long line of products working against <span class="tw-font-mono">%graph-store</span>. The
                  technology underlying Peat was first built at the turn of
                  2021-2022 to help restore Dalten Collective's chat and was, at
                  the time, called <span class="tw-font-mono">%oger</span>. Peat is vastly superior to our prior
                  effort in <span class="tw-font-mono">%oger</span>, and we think you'll like it.
                </p>
